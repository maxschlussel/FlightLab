- Controls
    - trim solver
        - Analytical from aero eq
            - Get equations from database?
        - Perterbations (from database)
        - Others
    - Better PID Control
        - make PID cascaded controls
            - outer loops vs inner loops 
            - apply control theory to make controls
        - Tune PIDs
        - Controls pos vs neg?
        - neg control gain integral opposes correction (roll loop)
        - Fast vs slow sensors/ lopps
        - linearize model
        - scheduled gains
        - PID → LQR → MPC → ML

- Sensors
    - Improve pitot tube and altimeter
    - Improve sensors (which) and delays/ params
    - random seed for sensors
        - Redo sensor random wlak when using seed in montecarlo
    - sensor sample rates
    - Start each imu sensor with some sort of bias

- Actuators
    - Improve actuators and delays
        - second order or first order delay

- Guidance
    - basic guidance algos 
        - guidance commands (loiter, waypoint, path) into references (altitude, speed, heading, attitude)
    - preplanned mission commands
    - pilot input (gui)

- Estamators
    - Fix simple estimator
    - Improve EKF
        - Process sensors seperatly in EKF for dif refresh rates (seperate matricies)

- Env
    - Add env (wind, gusts, pressure, density, temp etc)
        - env is input to sensor reading
    - Earth effects
        - Add earth/ gorund forces
        - agg ground effect


- Style/ Config
    - parse C cmd params properly
        - make config examples/basic_aircraft real functionality
    - Folder names (estimation, control, guidance, aircraft etc)
    - solidify units/ var names/ agnostic funcitons
        - Go thru code and unify func naming (EKF_getx)
    - Change make to cmake
    - acParam name to acModel
    - naming add SNS_readSensor? etc
    - function parameter naming convention x_output?
    - Defualt datalog path so user doesnt need to inut at runtime
    - add config file to make build run command so looks like make build run --congif etc
    - add const to docstrings?
    - Get and Set for control vars to clean interface
    - python venv in make script be reg python call
    - Eurler angle kinematix matrix func
    - getInertialVelocity function for eom and gps sensor calcs
    - Seperate sim from aircraft
        - make sim controls one line - sim runs regardles of if controls are config or not

- Improvments
    - Aero database
        - clean aerodynamics function structure to be per aricraft (modular)
    - Dif freq loops
    - Better logging
        - xdot fully computed in rk4
        - add logging to pid vals
        - Remove 2 names for log enums and make it so it goes off of emun name alone
    - Learn form githubs, yt
    - Port to c++?
    - Variable length arrays/ handle passing matricies / matrix functions better
    - Make mat mult (and others) safer so two input pointers to the same place dont corrupt (mat_mult(&A, &B, &A, N))
    - Make everthing arrays instead of structs?
    - Expand state vector?
    - Update project structure in readme
    - Better readme
        - Flightgear gif under intro (like https://github.com/jrsteensen/OpenHornet?tab=readme-ov-file)
        - go thru githubs
        - make better graphs (dark theme)/ gifs
        - make better flightgear gif (with lines of data in bottom right pos vel clock etc)
    - quats
    - learn about lineara\irty of force functions (isnt F=C * qinf * S always non linear bc of qinf)
    - unerstand why imu sensor bias random walk is * sqrt(dt)
    - Clean up:
        - State Vector.c/h
        - Matrix N x M functions
        - Aircraft sensors/ sensors file / naming struct
        - Sensors 2 array in aircraft sensors

- Test: 
    - const rotation
    - slow moment accel
    - still blows up wtih only pure moment
    - Create unit tests
